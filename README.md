# Portfolio-Management-System
The portfolio management system uses machine learning techniques to analyze financial data and optimize investments. 
This project develops a portfolio management system leveraging LSTM for predictive analytics, k-means clustering for effective asset grouping, and simulated annealing and diffferential evolution for portfolio optimization. It aids users in making informed investment decisions and maximizing returns. 

The file Final_KMeans_SA_DE_LSTM.ipynb has the final code. The rest of the files are initial attempts made in the process of reaching the end goal
